'30',\n"," 'dialogue': \"Speaker A: Cool. Do you wanna give me the little cable thing? Yeah. Cool. Ah, that's why it won't meet. Okay, cool. Yep, cool. Okay, functional requirements. Alright, yeah. It's working. Cool, okay. So what I have, wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab um observed remote control use with um a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire. Um so it was all about, you know, how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control, you know. What's the most annoying things about remote controls and um the possibility of speech recognition and L_C_D_ screens in remote control. Not that they actually gave me any answers on the L_C_D_ screens, so I should have taken that bit out, but anyway. Um okay, so. What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are, so you know, definitely you should be looking at something quite different. Um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly. Uh the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense. Uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um you know, a nice looking remote control. Um current remote controls, they don't match the user behaviour well, as you'll see on the next slide. Um I dunno what zapping is, but Oh, right. But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on. Um okay, fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons, so that's going back to what, you know, we were saying earlier about, you know, do you need all the buttons on the remote control, they just make it look ugly. Okay? Cool. Um so this is my little graph thing. Mm k Okay, well, I can send it to all of you. What it is is um it's cones, 'cause I thought they'd be more exciting. Um but ooh where's it go? Back. Oh. Oh yes, cool. Okay, I'm gonna stop playing with the little pointy thing. Um okay, so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection. What you can't see is volume selection, it's a little bit higher than all the others. Yeah, so what the graph shows is that, you know, power, channel selection and volume selection are important, and the rest of them, you know, nobody really uses and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like um their importance, you know, so on a scale of one to ten, how important is that and, you know, channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential, and the power, well it's not quite so essential, apparently, although I don't understand how it couldn't be, um and everything else, I think, you know, you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control, 'cause they're just not needed, and they're not used. Okay. This is the bit that the email messed up for me and that's what I was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing. Okay, cool. So um okay, so this is what people find annoying about remote controls. Uh that they get lost, that the uh you know, they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury. I think if you're watching enough T_V_ to get repetitive strain injury from um you know, watching T_V_, then that's the least of your problems, but you know, it's up there. Um that yeah. Okay, so um I mean the the R_S_I_ thing would be that, like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control and you know, not straining your wrists watching T_V_. Yes. Okay, cool. Right, um sorry this is pink because I was copying and pasting the table, and I didn't have time to white it out again. Um okay, but that shows how people whether they would pay more for voice recognition software. So you can see from that that, you know, younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software, whereas as people get older, they're a bit more sceptical about it and they're less willing to to try it. Um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about, but um you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_, you know, tends to be people talking and um, you know, how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_. Um okay? Cool. Um okay, so these are my personal preferences. So you have sleek, stylish, sophisticated, you know, so something that's, you know, a bit cool. Um you know, functional, so it's useful, but minimalist. Um there's a there's an important thing that, you know, people use when, you know, when you're filling up your home, you know, a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap, basically, you know, and you've got all this stuff, and you're just like, what the hell is that, who is ever gonna use it? You know, so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both, so I think we need to aim for both. Um okay, then a long battery life, like you were talking about earlier and um, you know, I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because, you know, your remote control just sits there, and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit. Um and then like a locator, so you know, kind of like you have for a mobile phone or not a mobile phone Yeah, that's it, you know. I know, it's weird. My flatmate and I were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and I was like I need to get one for everything. So yeah, so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps, something a kind of sound that you don't often hear on the T_V_, you know, 'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes, 'cause you you'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something. So okay? Cool. That's me. Cat's. Ca. Yeah, I mean that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey, you know, whether, you know, these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control, but I'm assuming, you know, yes. Well, that's when you go to uni, isn't it? So, you know Yeah. Oh, I've unplugged it. Do you want me to Yeah. Seventy six point three percent. Yeah. Yeah, I kn I mean I know what you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds, but I mean it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they don't have like I mean, you know, if you're at university, you're paying your rent, but you don't have a mortgage, you don't have a life insurance policy, you don't normally have a car, yeah, so. You're still learning to drive actually, so that just costs more than a car, but yeah. Um so I mean like it is an age group to target, really, I think. No, I mean that's what, that's like fifteen Pounds? You know, I think Yeah, I d I don't know many people without a T_V_. We didn't have a T_V_ last year, and everyone thought we were off our heads, you know. Yeah, I d well we've we've got quite a d decent T_V_. Yeah. I think I think the fact that, you know, ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes, I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control, does say quite a lot really. You know, so I mean that and the disposable income and I don't think it's something to ignore, you know. Is not a massive difference, you know. No, do totally. You do have it in your mobile phone though, don't you? Because you have like I mean every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them. I don't know. Yeah. S so y you'd maybe need a code word. Do you know what I mean? So like when you say change, except that's being said quite a lot on T_V_, so maybe like, you know, remote. I mean how often do people say remote on T_V_? Although I only watch Charmed, so really I wouldn't know but like so you'd just say remote five, you know, remote ten, remote one two nine. I don't think there's a lot of uh voice recognition remote controls. Yeah, that would be another way to do it. Yeah, but then the code word would be even more important, because I mean Sky advertise on every channel, don't they, you know, so then it would be you'd be watching Charmed, and then the Sky advert would come on and it would change to Sky. Yeah, yeah, and that would be really annoying. Yeah. Do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though? Yeah, you know, so you have to have the remote control. It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime, you can yell at it and it'll just change it, you can look for it later, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I suppose nearer to you but a b like if you have surround sound then Yeah. Yeah, 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control. Yeah, definitely, yeah. Oh, so y you want our um PowerPoint presentations in there, hey? Okay. There you go. But is everyone's called functional requirements? Okay, so that's good. That's me done. Okay, cool.\\nSpeaker B: No. Mm. Um um wi on on a what? Oh project project documents, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. Oh okay, yeah. Yes, I think so. Yeah, the last minute, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Um Okay. Hmm. Mm. Okay, yeah, afterwards, yeah, okay. Thanks. I think we need like some general discussion at the end probably. Yeah. Yeah, I think since since we were discussing some um design issues then I I I would like to continue okay, yeah. Thanks. Oh i Okay, I hope wait. Should it just There's just nothing. Oh right, right, right, um Okay. Nothin okay, something is coming up. No signal? Why? Oh. My my computer went blank now. Adjusting. But I don't see anything I don't see anything on my computer now. This is the problem, but Um. Uh now it's okay. No? No. Oh okay. Okay, that's fine, that's good. Okay, let's start from the beginning. So I'm going to speak about technical functions design uh just like some some first issues that came up. Um 'kay, so the method I was um adopting at this point, it's not um for the for the whole um period of the um all the project but it's just at th at this very moment. Um uh my method was um to look at um other um remote controls, uh so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what um functionality they used. And then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities. And yeah, and then just to um put the main function of the remote control in in words. Um so the findings uh were um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set, so this quite straightforward. And uh w some of the main functions would be switching on, switching off, uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels, or then mm uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel, so we would need the numbers. And and also the volume is very important. Um um I als okay. 'Kay. Um um among the findings I found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm functionalities um in their design, like operating a V_C_R_, but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players, but then there are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them, but according to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design. So my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size. And then it must be easy to use, so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something. Um then yeah, the must-have buttons would be on off and then the channel numbers and then um the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel, and then volume has to be there. But then um other functionalities um could be just uh there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then, um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um done through the menu. And yeah, the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n uh more functionalities, the answer was already no because of the last minute update. So at the for the time being that's uh that's all. If you have questions Yeah, and also it's it's um other question is uh because there are so many different And there are so many different things that could possibly be included because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the mm um video C_D_s and whatever, so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things. Um well, I think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use, I mean um what other options would you have? A little screen or something, but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user and and I mean the user just wants to get um get a result um quickly, not to spend time in like um giving several orders um I dunno. I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons, but if if you have other mm proposals um. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yep. Uh am I going in the right direction? No. Wait. Okay, here it comes. Okay, here you are. Um that's very good, very interesting. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, you share a television or something that yeah. It was seventy something, yeah, yeah. Yeah this this is not unaffordable, but the problem is whether people need it, whether they do have a T_V_ to use its full Yeah. Common, the students yeah, yeah. The s the stu yeah, and the remote control might not yeah, it might not even function with the old T_V_. Yeah, we're still yeah. Or w maybe we can just kind of uh uh Yeah, but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target, because actually I mean they're all still re young people. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. An Yeah. Yeah. Yeah but uh um Yeah, yeah sure, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons, but I think this is not really the right moment yet, because people are just so used to buttons and um, yeah it's it's kind of safer, so we we need both, so the voice recognition would be just an extra, it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote. Yeah but m but on the other hand, remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it and and the T_V_ would be already further away, so it might not pick up the other things coming from there. Yeah, but then the remote control I think I mean um the idea is kind of it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television, because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control, so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, but I I I was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us, a and uh not to yell at it from the distance. Okay. Oh yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah, mm-hmm. The major ones, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Did you find it? It's just yeah, yeah. Oh so so we'll just put them i there, we we yeah, w we won't even okay. Yeah. Yeah. Uh something conceptual, yeah. Hmm. Sorry, but um the next meeting um are we going to have it um right after lunch or shall we prepare our To prepare, okay, yeah, that's good. Okay. Cool. Okay, see you.\\nSpeaker C: Mm. You said uh targ target groups, what does that mean? Uh okay, 'kay. So are Okay. Alright. I can go first, yeah. Right. Um so f from the Right sure. Uh okay. So n uh with uh with regard to the uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh I've identified um a few basic uh components of the remote and uh se uh from the design, functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other. So this is the method that uh I'll mostly be following in my um in my uh role. Um the identification of the components, uh and uh since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects, I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and uh from the user interface person. Uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level and uh basically update and come up with a new design, so it's a cyclical process. Okay, so these were the basic findings from today. The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email. Uh I just quickly jotted them down. Um so basically uh the as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um and how the parts uh communicate with each other. Um okay, so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated, so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control. Um also uh the remote control should be used only for television, because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex. And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television. How however, our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the the use for television, in order to keep things simple. Um also the management wants that um our design should be unique uh it so it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard. Okay, so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control. Um there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface. The user interf interface communicates with the chip, so I'll basic go over to the Okay. So if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell, uh it communicates uh it feeds energy into the into the chip, which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything. There is a user interface here. So whe when the user presses a button, it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal, um which then so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code, which is then communicated to the remote site, which h has an infrared receiver. Um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating. Um so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control, whatever new functions that we need to do, um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger, basically. Okay. Um so i in my personal preferences um I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible. This would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time. And uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design, so that our um uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most uh televisions. That's about it. So anything that you would like to know or No, I don't have any idea about what each component costs. Um yeah. Anything else? Yeah. Certainly, yeah. So so tha yeah, we definitely need to operate within our constraints, but um unfortunately I I do not have any data, so uh I just identified the functional components for that. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Mm 'kay. I it'll take some time. Oh, there it is, yeah. It'll come up, it um uh no signal. Yeah yeah, it says something now, adjusting Okay. Oh, that's strange. Okay. And one more time. Mm. Sorry, cou could you go back for a second? Uh switching on off channel, uh volume, okay, that's great. So in the u user interface requirements uh uh uh we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want. Um but um so so at this stage, uh how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or I mean in we can completely do away with buttons and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that. But uh is is there any uh uh any thoughts on that? Right. Yeah, and it'll make the costs yeah. Right. Uh I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them. So well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that. Uh i if the if the costs allow, we can have like an L_C_D_ display and uh with um because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well. So yeah? Cool. try to press oh, okay, yep. Mm. Right. Mm-hmm. Mm. Right. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Right. Mm. Mm. Mm. Some kind of a ring, some Right. Hmm. Okay, that's great, thanks. Mm. I think one of the very interesting things that came up in um uh Ka Kate Cat Cat's uh presentation was um uh this this issue of uh uh like voice recognition being more popular with uh younger people. So if we need to have a target group um then uh I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned, if we want to have something sleek and uh you know, good looking uh we are better off targeting a younger audience then um you know, people who are comparatively elderly. Um. Right. Right. Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them, so if you want to put in something stylish, then uh th it'll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people, yeah. Right, and Right. Mm. Right. But uh still, if if you can go back to that slide and uh, how popular was it? Oh, oh, okay. That's alright, if you can just look it up on your computer, wh uh um people between twenty five to thirty five, uh how popular was so it was sti still still quite popular amongst them. So even they are seventy six percent, is that high amount? Alright. Yeah. So you're more likely to b Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular, right? So mm uh are are are Mm. Mm. Um I was having a a general outlook on um m most like sophisticated features, but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about, because one of the p uh things that Cat pointed out was uh uh how do we go about implementing it? Uh and uh Yeah. But how frequently do we use it anyway and um uh h ho how good is it, you know uh voice recognition softwares are still quite uh Yeah. Right. Right. Okay. O Right. Mm. Right. Yeah. Okay, so it seems like a feasible thing to implement uh for for a limited yeah. Mm. W What uh Mm. What wh uh what I was thinking is that there is this uh separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control. If we can do with away with that, our product can be really popular uh in the sense that uh a person can say, I want to watch uh I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five. Yeah, so if uh if something like that can be incorporated, some kind of Mm-hmm. Alright. Yeah, that's Right. Mm. Mm yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control being cl I mean it'll it'll mm. Yeah. Mm. So uh wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the T_V_, so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control, wherever it is, it'll beep, so we we can probably come to know where it is. Right, yeah, yeah, yeah. Alright, yeah. Right. Okay. So where exactly is this i Ah, okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah in that one, right yeah. No. Right. I guess I'll find out. Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into? Con components, oh.\\nSpeaker D: All hooked up. Okay, so now we are here at the functional design meeting. Um hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually. The agenda for the meeting, I put it in the sh shared documents folder. I don't know if that meant that you could see it or not. Did anyone? No. Oh well. Um I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there, there's a shared project documents folder. Um and it should be in there. Project documents, yeah. So I'll put it in there. Is it best if I send you an email maybe, to let you know it's there? Yep. I'll do that next time. Um I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through, and then I'll send them to you after the meeting. The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time, so we'll go through each of you one by one. Um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us. I just sent at the last minute, I'm sorry about that, but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing. Um and then we need to, by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things, target group and functions of the remote control. And we've got forty minutes to do that in. So I would say yeah? As uh who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to, yeah. So we need to yeah, we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on and then look at the functions um of the dem remote control itself. So with that I think it's best if I hand over to you. Does anyone have a preference for going first? You wanna go first? Okay, so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours. I assume we just pull it out? Just before you start, to make it easier, would you three mind emailing me your presentations? Once we you don't have to do it now but when once you go back, just so that I don't have to scribble everything down. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Do you have any um i idea about costs at this point? Br Okay. 'Cause that's something to consider, I guess, if we're if we're using more advanced technology, it might increase the price. Yeah. That's fine. Are there any more questions, or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end? Yeah, I think that will do. Okay, so do you want to Yes, shall shall we pull this up? I think that has to come out of there. Yeah. Yeah, I thought those last minute things, they're gonna hit you the worst. It ta takes a little Oh, and have you you need to then also press on yours, function F_ eight, so the blue function key at the bottom and F_ eight. Now it's coming, computer no signal. Maybe again? Okay, adjusting. There we go, there we go. Oh, if you press if you press function and that again there's there's usually three modes, one where it's only here, one where it's only there, and one where it's both. Okay, so one more time. Should yeah just wait for a moment, adjusting. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. If I mean that was the the directive that came through from management, but if we had a a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video and D_V_D_, I could get back to them and see. It's w it's just whether it's worth arguing about. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one? Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Sure, we can discuss that maybe after the next one. Do you want to yeah. Oh, I'm getting hungry. You set? Uh we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on here. Hello. Is it plugged in prop it's working? Okay. Excellent. It's um switching between channels, sort of randomly going through. Mm. Ooh, that's a bit difficult to see. If you explain it to us it'll be fine. Yeah. I liked the, I liked the litt ooh come back. No. Okay. Mm-hmm, that's the next one along, yeah? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. The remote control. Mm-hmm. That's alright. Mm. Keys and things like that, yeah. Whistle and it screams at you, yeah. Mm-hmm. That's you, excellent. Um. I'm just gonna tick yes. So, we've got about ten, fifteen minutes to discuss Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket and the I don't know how often they're buying televisions. Yeah, but you don't have much money, generally. I would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five, when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and O oh it's on sorry, we unplugged it. Here, let me Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, they've got no commitments and usually not a car and all of those things. Kids. Yeah. Yeah, and if we're if we're talking twenty five Euros as a price, that's not unaffordable, even for young people. Yeah. Yeah. But do they But the T_V_s are often kind of someone's old T_V_ that's blah blah and be a bit strange to have a fancy rome remote. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five, but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition. Is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. With um but with a T_V_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five, louder, tha that should be relatively simple. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check. Um, so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group and then of course we're going to get th anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money, then they'll they'll still go for the same advertising. Yeah, I think we need both. Yeah. Mm. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So that if that was in the the voice recognition, that would be great. Yeah. Yeah. Watch Sky and yeah. Mm-hmm. But that's definitely a possibility. Yeah. So that you can yell at it, yeah. Yeah. Alright. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. That's but then if you're buying the remote separately, but y you could have something, but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the T_V_ or something, some like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack, so one part attaches to the T_V_. The l Well that's right, but it solves the problem of having different noises. Yeah. Okay, I think we're gonna have to wrap this up um. But if we go away with that that kind of general um specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds, we want it to look simple, but still have the buttons so it's easy to use, but only those key buttons, the major buttons and then one sort of menu one, and then voice recognition included as an option um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um. What we have to do now is to go back to our little places, complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation, which y you'll get immediately by email. Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes, and then we've got a lunch break and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work. Um I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder, but I'll send you an email when I do it, so that you know. It should be on your desktop, so on the yeah. So I'll put it I'll put them there as soon as I've written them. Yeah, and email them round. Yeah, that would be great. Oh yeah, put them in there. Yeah, then you don't have to email them. No, they're all called something slightly different. Technical requirements and something something, yeah. So, if you put them in there, we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to. Um as to where we're going from here, you're going to look at the components concept. Yeah? Whatever that means. Yeah. You'll be looking you'll be looking at the user interface concept, on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map or something that um we'll keep keep our options op hmm? Components, yeah. No, we have we have after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare, so that's fine, w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary. Okay? Right on time. Okay, so you can I guess we'll see you for lunch in a sec?\",\n"," 'summary': 'The project manager opens the meeting by stating that they will address functional design and then going over the agenda. The industrial designer gives his presentation, explaining how remote controls function and giving personal preference to a clear, simple design that upgrades the technology as well as incorporates the latest features in chip design. The interface specialist gives her presentation next, addressing the main purpose of a remote control. She pinpoints the main functions of on/off, channel-switching, numbers for choosing particular channels, and volume; and also suggests adding a menu button to change settings such as brightness on the screen. She gives preference to a remote that is small, easy to use, and follows some conventions. The group briefly discusses the possibility of using an LCD screen if cost allows it, since it is fancy and fashionable. The marketing expert presents, giving statistical information from a survey of 100 subjects. She prefers a remote that is sleek, stylish, sophisticated, cool, beautiful, functional, solar-powered, has long battery life, and has a locator.

'cause i am not very sure , plastic , titanium or whatever . there's another point i want to make , is that the uh well you've seen them i le na my presentation that um i point out some why buttons are not the mm not the only ways you can use so the user interface is uh i it uses the aspect uh of a computer system , we can uh see in our uh r_ and d_ uh if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy . a programme which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user and the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data . we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here . the idea is to represent buttons as figures , diagrams , symbols and on so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing . a graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures . so the here are some examples . so they cluster the buttons together . they group them into col they colour them and uh they have different forms as well . but this interface are kind of confusing . uh basically there are too many buttons . so some people are propose voice recognition ah by the way i receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine for this by a company when you tell the you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you . and it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used so we might consider that , supposedly . mm so somebody some people use uh some people use a spinning wheel th with the l_c_ display so instead of using the mm buttons you have a l_c_d_ screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons , touch screen , i mean . and some people propose a scroll button . integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button . so there are a few aspects that i collected here . so s basically this deals with special users , children , handicapped people , old people , basically they are programmable , and then they also secure uh covers , to protect but we don't have to integrate all these complicated features . i'm just saying that the currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f customisable for different people . and uh you see this is the one where you have the protection cover . mm maybe useful for children , and for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside . so the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside . this is another company that provides big buttons . i see that that is useful for old people but for our product we don't need a big one because you have voice recognition e eventually with use . we should include speech synthesis in this case , no ? but uh as norman say if uh there is uh already a commercial product available who t who do this we we can check uh to integrate it i into our uh new remote control . and uh , this is another one the the the part that's a v_ standing for the volume . so there's a up arrow and a down arrow . but you the see that in the v_ , the v_ appears to be the down arrow on the top so it's confusing interface , and here are is uh here is a s short summary that i summary that i compiled after the findings i found . big buttons are convenient , voice recognition helps , push buttons , scroll buttons , spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools . and uh user customisable is important and finally simplicity simplicity is the key . we have many concepts there but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used . well i i think you it's it's it's fine you have uh reviewed all all the possibilities but uh uh well uh i if we consider that uh the user interface is displayed on the t_v_ screen i don't think we nee uh we need much buttons in the remote since we we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that , because uh adding wheels or scrolls uh makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also , so . or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control and we should have just a button like help and you say uh and you ik you press the button help yeah . that's a good idea . so you are display on the screen . on the t_v_ screen the uh how to use your remote . so that eliminates all the complicated documentation , but people are often enough looking at the help , in the case where they need help , in the case where they need help . and let us see what the market demands . it's just for user customizable , for kids or old people . i mean it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids can be used by both kids and old people . well uh what i s propose is that uh you know a remote controller , i it could be a cube , is uh a small device that uh looks like a cube and maybe you can just change the um the buttons , if you ch turn one side you get one one buttons , you turn the other side you get the other buttons , so we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes . and we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires . so seventy percent of the users , they find their remote controls very ugly , they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything . and eighty percent of the people they are always l i mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy . and the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . and seventy five percent of the users said they zap a lot . and fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons , so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they're not used most of the times . and also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls . fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room and um if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it . fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex . so keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations i think this should be the solution for them . we should have an l_c_d_ on the rem remote control . well mm w well i i i don't really see the advantage of having uh l_c_d_ on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and uh display on the screen . yeah of course it's fancy trendy and so on i mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy . so if we have a l_c_d_ on the remote , rather than looking onto the t_v_ you just look into a remote and navigate it . it's the same menu as we have saw that ipod remote control . yeah but when you play with the ipod you don't have a big screen in front of you , s you can use this screen instead of the big se screen , if you re-use the existing screen , we element eliminate the l_c_d_ , and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful , fancy , well i think we we can focus on the uh on the fancy look on the speech recognition if the technology is available but well i think l_c_d_ will uh will uh make us spend a lot of money for not so big results . so the thing is you can find out how much an l_c_d_ will cost i mean that should be found out by the industrial designers . and it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls . and also the cost for the speech recognition . ask our r_ and d_ department . yeah it's o only for a limited vocabulary , say eighty commands or so . and also the scroller button , how much will it cost . well uh compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button . from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button . because they they just they're just frightened to use the scrollings or help button . yeah i i i think that uh well uh as we have seen in the in the presentation uh well uh about uh uh fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button so uh i think to have uh five uh simple button is sufficient for our functionality . or maybe we can u uh or maybe we can uh make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others . but if i i if we if we could have a a a display uh g a user interface that is very complete on the t_v_ screen i think that just five buttons are sufficient , one to go up left right down and uh enter and you you you just select the functionality you want to access or things like that . or it could be like this , as the people say , if they have a l_c_d_ on the remote not on the television . because when you have the l_c_d_ onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background , so if you have then l_c_d_ in the remote , you just have a menu , and this menu when you press the menu , in the l_c_d_ displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume , then the program , then the brightness , contrast and all the stuff . and i think it's increases the cost of the the remote control if you use l_c_d_ . i because if there are few buttons , you don't have to look at your your controller any more i think that there's no contradiction here , so if you wanna control the screen d sh sharpness you just say sharpness and then you t turn you just press lef increase or decrease button if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel , so finally that wil eliminates the the need for l_c_d_ , and the third problem was to find the remote control . but the uh the thing is is i is that we can add a functionality on the on the t_v_ screen but they are just less used compar it doesn't mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important . and then you choose with the with the button to well you navigate well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like uh find you will listen to a peep , special peep . that's exactly what i mean by voice commander . uh it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control , and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger . so we have some one charger there and when we're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere , in the charger we have a small button , and just by pressing the button in the charger the uh remote control beeps , wherever it is . and that's a good idea , i mean it doe it also doesn't require a voice command , because there are problems with a voice command . i mean charger would be fixed what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off t_v_ button , the off button , the remote there be s uh instruction on the screen , please charge charge me . because uh every time you're off the computer the t_v_ you are asked the the command the t_v_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where to the charger . you never get it lost and of course the final point is a fancy look . as we have seen earlier the remotes which were displayed by norman they weren't fancy , i mean mm very big or something with lot of buttons . but you can have an button for child lock . i mean uh i mean uh i mean uh you see if it's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and use it , you can't avoid him . so just by pressing the button with some code , you t you put a lock onto the remote , so that he can't use even well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the t_v_ you can uh well write a code or choose a category , if it is kids , uh things like that . or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids i think these other four points they're the market demands and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think so for my part i will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use , where to use , and s uh and so on . i think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser yeah i think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these could be included . because uh if you want uh say we can sort by channels or sort by t_v_ programs , you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them . and you can say to your remote control like uh sports and then on the t_v_ you have a list with with uh uh well with sports program playing now we have a problem there . you see uh if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on uh basketball score or something , and if the score comes twenty four thirty five , you've just say twenty five and suddenly the screen the channel goes to twenty five . well but well e every possible word uh has a probability to come about of the t_v_ so . so i think there should be a prefix to some numbers ordinary twenty five you almost there's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent and t_v_ twenty five i dunno it will be round about one or two percent . but i i i think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers . that will be too big . and it will be difficult for the vocabulary also . check with the v r_ and d_ department the capability of recogniser . it will be difficult to say just the name of the channel . but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary . als might be you just forgot the channel name , you kno only know the number . or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary , i think there's another way you can do is that uh you can uh if when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example , then what you can do is that the you can make the t_v_ screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel , you just use the control button uh , you just you you just choose the the option you want or lets the user create his own vocabulary of channel . just you have uh in the beginning you have uh t you have to train the s well the the speech uh r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two . if if there is uh more than one person who is watching t_v_ if we are using the television in the different environments , say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work , that would bring a bad name bad uh reputation for our company . so i think we should specify some pre-requirements if we want to use a voice commands , or we can switch on or switch off the the special , yeah . well i think that's a good uh a good option because it's simple and uh simple to implement also , so . maybe we'll discuss them in next meeting . i think these are the practical problems . so we need to take care of them in the design . it's time to close this meeting .\",\n          \"so in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the for the remote control . so let's see the what did you prepare . s so so i discussed with guillaume . and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an l_c_d_ or not because it's too expensive . one with and one without l_c_d_s . um but both comes with a charger and then detachable and uh or control module . and detachable big buttons for all people um . here we have the first one with the beautiful uh l_c_d_ um display . s okay so i'll show you the the two prototypes . and you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick-like uh button . you can uh choose the direction you have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the for the speech recognition system here . and here the the switch that control if you want the the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere . is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ? well so it's a microphone array . oh it's very costly , microphone array . it's just a single microphone , i i think uh we we put it here because i think when you when you are browsing your l_c_d_ you will be close to well it's better to to to place it here th than here , for instance . and here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off . and uh so this remote control comes up with its charger . how much does it cost this one ? well this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars ah it's above it's above the budget . but uh it's just a prototype the and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars . how many b battery is there ? is it n the two a_a_s batteries in it . a_a_ rechargeable batteries . is that two or one ? actually uh it's a flexible thing . so and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger and uh leave it uh alone , it's alright . i forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , this button is like the mouse is like a joystick , you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button . you can move up , down , left , right , or you can do a swing . here i present another version without the l_c_d_ . so we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration . the second version is also simpler , we d uh we had just uh i have to put the microphone also . uh-huh and also the switch . basically it's the same uh things uh uh as uh i presented before . but here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation . press one button uh acting as a a enter button . so um yeah according to what you said it's more robust to the user . and uh it's also cheaper to produce . we can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars . and i think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger , and if you disable speech recognition system then ? w w i'll i'll come to that point later on . in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah . it's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone but uh again depends on the types . i think we have to investigate more on that , but the price should be below twelve and a half euro . but as the marketing manager says , people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design . but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment . the price of selling is twenty five euros . the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular if you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , something like customised . yeah for example the l_c_d_ , you can take it you can put it put it back in , or you can use the other one , or the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah . you want a microphone to put in the speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see . it's pretty flexible in the yeah price . you also have the the the two other modules for the parental control that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and uh which channel you want to choose and so on . h here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch t_v_ , up they come up with their modules , we also have this module for uh old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , and it acts like the previous one , you just plug in and it works . the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful . simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n that's our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here . okay now we come to other important features that i did not tell you . the first one is the speech recogniser , again it's detachable or add-on . and then we also have security feature it's very robust , and the material , what's the material again ? the titanium again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one , again because this is a_a_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want . lithium-ion may be a good one , again you pay for what you get , and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . so when you finish watching your t_v_ and you the you t you turn off the t_v_ , uh and then there's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger , and it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define and then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a of t_v_ programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children . what's the price to p to produce ? well so the price to produce for uh the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device . the without without the charger it's about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems . two dollars for the uh for the add-on modules , and finally three dollars for the charger . so if you uh sum up uh everything wi with the l_c_d_ , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two . we don't have all the options . so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars . so you want more function you pay more . it's below the the the budget . i think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements , and we can finalise the product based on this discu so the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings , and uh in the market the people are not really interested with l_c_d_ , without l_c_d_ , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , it should be very fancy with colourful and uh very handy to hold . and the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative . of course in that we could put l_c_d_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative . and the third one is easy to use . since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the t_v_ screen uh uh with just four buttons . well i think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself here you can find these are the latest fashion updates , and so this in paris and milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like . so i think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes . and the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , it should be somewhat spongy . you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy . yeah so uh so finally we have these three criterias . one is fancy look , second is innovative , and third is easy to use . so and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these , say that we have a seven point scale , from one to seven , and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this . so on this scale , if it is true , if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one , so now you have with l_c_d_ and without l_c_d_ , or if it is false , it doesn't it looks uh it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven . but who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party ? according to you designers , on on this scale the l_c_d_ remote control . how do you look how does it look ? d is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ? i'll i'll say three or four . i think we can improve on the design . som someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh design . um we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity . so i take three on with l_c_d_ ? so without l_c_d_ how would you rate it ? uh four . i think it's it's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated so removing the l_c_d_ um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look . and in the sense of innovativeness , with l_c_d_ . well it's it's the same for both so i will give a five , six . from the innovation aspect i feel that uh what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that um the retrieval of t_v_ programmes by content , and for now and another innovation we have is simplicity and simplicity , few buttons , we've uh a lot of functionalities . so without l_c_d_ ? mm for both it's the the same innovations . so maybe i can put six to seven . actually uh to make it with l_c_d_ you make more efforts . then when it is without l_c_d_ there is not much innovativeness . uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the l_c_d_ ? but you have the same programme on the t_v_ screen . we haven't really uh determined what are actually actually i mean on the l_c_d_ , according to what i understand from your model is , you have a joystick here , and you have l_c_d_ , you just press your joystick , you get here a programme . on the t_v_ you don't it doesn't display on the t_v_ now . if you have the l_c_d_ , then uh there is no meaning in having it on the t_v_ . but you cannot display all on a l_c_d_ . anyway for for the users who who who opt for l_c_d_ we'll give them the give them the l_c_d_ , so without l_c_d_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ? well i think both are really easy to use and uh well t p the menu are clear , well-organised , so so i will give a six for the easy to use . no it's just if i i see the the f the rate i think it's better to do it without l_c_d_ . because that's with l_c_d_ just will increase the price , so i mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes according to fruit and vegetable or a spongy touch without l_c_d_ and without speech recognition . i have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect . i think the easy to use uh aspect is different for different people . for the young generation easy to use may be very complicated because uh they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons . for kids they want simply the s similarit for the old people they want simplicity , but but uh what i'm trying to say here is that the um we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people . so without l_c_d_ i just take it five ? um six . and it's going to be much simpler to use . so let's go back to our laboratory and to improve on the design . what about the integration of speech recognition ? the speech recogniser is a add-on module . that's going to be an optional . s s oh i think it's better to have this without l_c_d_ . as our programme manager s pro project manager says that without l_c_d_ it is going to reduce the cost also , i think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , because maybe parents will lose these uh but i mean if you have an add-ons , the kids may just uh hide the parental module or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or , the problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component , and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people , and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them . so you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional uh will be optional . but the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ? i think it inc increase . because it's three different pieces uh to to to build but it's i think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the functionalities um on the same module , but uh well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the you're gonna keep the same customer , because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons . i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future . attracting them to come back in again and again . yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be can be upgraded , it would be a good thing right ? and uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls ? uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ? but we are also the um well the components will have to change because uh we have to deal with the shape or uh it could be like this the p_c_b_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all . what we can change is to propose the customers with skins . for example the i the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin and then people just feel that oh i have a new skin and looks better . we can have the same global shape and then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that . i think you need to look into the material . i think the project manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models . project evaluation project satisfaction , for example . i don't know , we have to ask these question . room for creativity . this room is a bit small , but but i think it's okay for us to work with . this is fine for making a presentat for project presentations . and the leadership was excellent . yeah i think so . uh the teamwork was very very good . and new ideas found . come up with new product . yeah and also more well uh more seriously i think it's it's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that , we achieved uh project goal i think . that is within the budget . yes , more or less . without without l_c_d_ , without speech recognition , it will be simple . yeah thank you for your work and\",\n          \"kira bought a new bed this weekend

'cause i am not very sure , plastic , titanium or whatever . there's another point i want to make , is that the uh well you've seen them i le na my presentation that um i point out some why buttons are not the mm not the only ways you can use so the user interface is uh i it uses the aspect uh of a computer system , we can uh see in our uh r_ and d_ uh if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy . a programme which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user and the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data . we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here . the idea is to represent buttons as figures , diagrams , symbols and on so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing . a graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures . so the here are some examples . so they cluster the buttons together . they group them into col they colour them and uh they have different forms as well . but this interface are kind of confusing . uh basically there are too many buttons . so some people are propose voice recognition ah by the way i receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine for this by a company when you tell the you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you . and it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used so we might consider that , supposedly . mm so somebody some people use uh some people use a spinning wheel th with the l_c_ display so instead of using the mm buttons you have a l_c_d_ screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons , touch screen , i mean . and some people propose a scroll button . integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button . so there are a few aspects that i collected here . so s basically this deals with special users , children , handicapped people , old people , basically they are programmable , and then they also secure uh covers , to protect but we don't have to integrate all these complicated features . i'm just saying that the currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f customisable for different people . and uh you see this is the one where you have the protection cover . mm maybe useful for children , and for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside . so the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside . this is another company that provides big buttons . i see that that is useful for old people but for our product we don't need a big one because you have voice recognition e eventually with use . we should include speech synthesis in this case , no ? but uh as norman say if uh there is uh already a commercial product available who t who do this we we can check uh to integrate it i into our uh new remote control . and uh , this is another one the the the part that's a v_ standing for the volume . so there's a up arrow and a down arrow . but you the see that in the v_ , the v_ appears to be the down arrow on the top so it's confusing interface , and here are is uh here is a s short summary that i summary that i compiled after the findings i found . big buttons are convenient , voice recognition helps , push buttons , scroll buttons , spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools . and uh user customisable is important and finally simplicity simplicity is the key . we have many concepts there but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used . well i i think you it's it's it's fine you have uh reviewed all all the possibilities but uh uh well uh i if we consider that uh the user interface is displayed on the t_v_ screen i don't think we nee uh we need much buttons in the remote since we we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that , because uh adding wheels or scrolls uh makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also , so . or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control and we should have just a button like help and you say uh and you ik you press the button help yeah . that's a good idea . so you are display on the screen . on the t_v_ screen the uh how to use your remote . so that eliminates all the complicated documentation , but people are often enough looking at the help , in the case where they need help , in the case where they need help . and let us see what the market demands . it's just for user customizable , for kids or old people . i mean it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids can be used by both kids and old people . well uh what i s propose is that uh you know a remote controller , i it could be a cube , is uh a small device that uh looks like a cube and maybe you can just change the um the buttons , if you ch turn one side you get one one buttons , you turn the other side you get the other buttons , so we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes . and we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires . so seventy percent of the users , they find their remote controls very ugly , they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything . and eighty percent of the people they are always l i mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy . and the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . and seventy five percent of the users said they zap a lot . and fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons , so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they're not used most of the times . and also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls . fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room and um if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it . fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex . so keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations i think this should be the solution for them . we should have an l_c_d_ on the rem remote control . well mm w well i i i don't really see the advantage of having uh l_c_d_ on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and uh display on the screen . yeah of course it's fancy trendy and so on i mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy . so if we have a l_c_d_ on the remote , rather than looking onto the t_v_ you just look into a remote and navigate it . it's the same menu as we have saw that ipod remote control . yeah but when you play with the ipod you don't have a big screen in front of you , s you can use this screen instead of the big se screen , if you re-use the existing screen , we element eliminate the l_c_d_ , and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful , fancy , well i think we we can focus on the uh on the fancy look on the speech recognition if the technology is available but well i think l_c_d_ will uh will uh make us spend a lot of money for not so big results . so the thing is you can find out how much an l_c_d_ will cost i mean that should be found out by the industrial designers . and it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls . and also the cost for the speech recognition . ask our r_ and d_ department . yeah it's o only for a limited vocabulary , say eighty commands or so . and also the scroller button , how much will it cost . well uh compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button . from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button . because they they just they're just frightened to use the scrollings or help button . yeah i i i think that uh well uh as we have seen in the in the presentation uh well uh about uh uh fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button so uh i think to have uh five uh simple button is sufficient for our functionality . or maybe we can u uh or maybe we can uh make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others . but if i i if we if we could have a a a display uh g a user interface that is very complete on the t_v_ screen i think that just five buttons are sufficient , one to go up left right down and uh enter and you you you just select the functionality you want to access or things like that . or it could be like this , as the people say , if they have a l_c_d_ on the remote not on the television . because when you have the l_c_d_ onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background , so if you have then l_c_d_ in the remote , you just have a menu , and this menu when you press the menu , in the l_c_d_ displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume , then the program , then the brightness , contrast and all the stuff . and i think it's increases the cost of the the remote control if you use l_c_d_ . i because if there are few buttons , you don't have to look at your your controller any more i think that there's no contradiction here , so if you wanna control the screen d sh sharpness you just say sharpness and then you t turn you just press lef increase or decrease button if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel , so finally that wil eliminates the the need for l_c_d_ , and the third problem was to find the remote control . but the uh the thing is is i is that we can add a functionality on the on the t_v_ screen but they are just less used compar it doesn't mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important . and then you choose with the with the button to well you navigate well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like uh find you will listen to a peep , special peep . that's exactly what i mean by voice commander . uh it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control , and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger . so we have some one charger there and when we're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere , in the charger we have a small button , and just by pressing the button in the charger the uh remote control beeps , wherever it is . and that's a good idea , i mean it doe it also doesn't require a voice command , because there are problems with a voice command . i mean charger would be fixed what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off t_v_ button , the off button , the remote there be s uh instruction on the screen , please charge charge me . because uh every time you're off the computer the t_v_ you are asked the the command the t_v_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where to the charger . you never get it lost and of course the final point is a fancy look . as we have seen earlier the remotes which were displayed by norman they weren't fancy , i mean mm very big or something with lot of buttons . but you can have an button for child lock . i mean uh i mean uh i mean uh you see if it's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and use it , you can't avoid him . so just by pressing the button with some code , you t you put a lock onto the remote , so that he can't use even well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the t_v_ you can uh well write a code or choose a category , if it is kids , uh things like that . or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids i think these other four points they're the market demands and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think so for my part i will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use , where to use , and s uh and so on . i think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser yeah i think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these could be included . because uh if you want uh say we can sort by channels or sort by t_v_ programs , you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them . and you can say to your remote control like uh sports and then on the t_v_ you have a list with with uh uh well with sports program playing now we have a problem there . you see uh if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on uh basketball score or something , and if the score comes twenty four thirty five , you've just say twenty five and suddenly the screen the channel goes to twenty five . well but well e every possible word uh has a probability to come about of the t_v_ so . so i think there should be a prefix to some numbers ordinary twenty five you almost there's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent and t_v_ twenty five i dunno it will be round about one or two percent . but i i i think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers . that will be too big . and it will be difficult for the vocabulary also . check with the v r_ and d_ department the capability of recogniser . it will be difficult to say just the name of the channel . but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary . als might be you just forgot the channel name , you kno only know the number . or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary , i think there's another way you can do is that uh you can uh if when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example , then what you can do is that the you can make the t_v_ screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel , you just use the control button uh , you just you you just choose the the option you want or lets the user create his own vocabulary of channel . just you have uh in the beginning you have uh t you have to train the s well the the speech uh r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two . if if there is uh more than one person who is watching t_v_ if we are using the television in the different environments , say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work , that would bring a bad name bad uh reputation for our company . so i think we should specify some pre-requirements if we want to use a voice commands , or we can switch on or switch off the the special , yeah . well i think that's a good uh a good option because it's simple and uh simple to implement also , so . maybe we'll discuss them in next meeting . i think these are the practical problems . so we need to take care of them in the design . it's time to close this meeting .\",\n          \"so in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the for the remote control . so let's see the what did you prepare . s so so i discussed with guillaume . and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an l_c_d_ or not because it's too expensive . one with and one without l_c_d_s . um but both comes with a charger and then detachable and uh or control module . and detachable big buttons for all people um . here we have the first one with the beautiful uh l_c_d_ um display . s okay so i'll show you the the two prototypes . and you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick-like uh button . you can uh choose the direction you have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the for the speech recognition system here . and here the the switch that control if you want the the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere . is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ? well so it's a microphone array . oh it's very costly , microphone array . it's just a single microphone , i i think uh we we put it here because i think when you when you are browsing your l_c_d_ you will be close to well it's better to to to place it here th than here , for instance . and here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off . and uh so this remote control comes up with its charger . how much does it cost this one ? well this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars ah it's above it's above the budget . but uh it's just a prototype the and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars . how many b battery is there ? is it n the two a_a_s batteries in it . a_a_ rechargeable batteries . is that two or one ? actually uh it's a flexible thing . so and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger and uh leave it uh alone , it's alright . i forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , this button is like the mouse is like a joystick , you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button . you can move up , down , left , right , or you can do a swing . here i present another version without the l_c_d_ . so we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration . the second version is also simpler , we d uh we had just uh i have to put the microphone also . uh-huh and also the switch . basically it's the same uh things uh uh as uh i presented before . but here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation . press one button uh acting as a a enter button . so um yeah according to what you said it's more robust to the user . and uh it's also cheaper to produce . we can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars . and i think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger , and if you disable speech recognition system then ? w w i'll i'll come to that point later on . in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah . it's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone but uh again depends on the types . i think we have to investigate more on that , but the price should be below twelve and a half euro . but as the marketing manager says , people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design . but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment . the price of selling is twenty five euros . the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular if you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , something like customised . yeah for example the l_c_d_ , you can take it you can put it put it back in , or you can use the other one , or the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah . you want a microphone to put in the speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see . it's pretty flexible in the yeah price . you also have the the the two other modules for the parental control that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and uh which channel you want to choose and so on . h here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch t_v_ , up they come up with their modules , we also have this module for uh old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , and it acts like the previous one , you just plug in and it works . the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful . simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n that's our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here . okay now we come to other important features that i did not tell you . the first one is the speech recogniser , again it's detachable or add-on . and then we also have security feature it's very robust , and the material , what's the material again ? the titanium again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one , again because this is a_a_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want . lithium-ion may be a good one , again you pay for what you get , and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . so when you finish watching your t_v_ and you the you t you turn off the t_v_ , uh and then there's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger , and it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define and then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a of t_v_ programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children . what's the price to p to produce ? well so the price to produce for uh the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device . the without without the charger it's about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems . two dollars for the uh for the add-on modules , and finally three dollars for the charger . so if you uh sum up uh everything wi with the l_c_d_ , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two . we don't have all the options . so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars . so you want more function you pay more . it's below the the the budget . i think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements , and we can finalise the product based on this discu so the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings , and uh in the market the people are not really interested with l_c_d_ , without l_c_d_ , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , it should be very fancy with colourful and uh very handy to hold . and the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative . of course in that we could put l_c_d_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative . and the third one is easy to use . since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the t_v_ screen uh uh with just four buttons . well i think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself here you can find these are the latest fashion updates , and so this in paris and milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like . so i think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes . and the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , it should be somewhat spongy . you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy . yeah so uh so finally we have these three criterias . one is fancy look , second is innovative , and third is easy to use . so and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these , say that we have a seven point scale , from one to seven , and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this . so on this scale , if it is true , if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one , so now you have with l_c_d_ and without l_c_d_ , or if it is false , it doesn't it looks uh it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven . but who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party ? according to you designers , on on this scale the l_c_d_ remote control . how do you look how does it look ? d is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ? i'll i'll say three or four . i think we can improve on the design . som someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh design . um we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity . so i take three on with l_c_d_ ? so without l_c_d_ how would you rate it ? uh four . i think it's it's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated so removing the l_c_d_ um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look . and in the sense of innovativeness , with l_c_d_ . well it's it's the same for both so i will give a five , six . from the innovation aspect i feel that uh what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that um the retrieval of t_v_ programmes by content , and for now and another innovation we have is simplicity and simplicity , few buttons , we've uh a lot of functionalities . so without l_c_d_ ? mm for both it's the the same innovations . so maybe i can put six to seven . actually uh to make it with l_c_d_ you make more efforts . then when it is without l_c_d_ there is not much innovativeness . uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the l_c_d_ ? but you have the same programme on the t_v_ screen . we haven't really uh determined what are actually actually i mean on the l_c_d_ , according to what i understand from your model is , you have a joystick here , and you have l_c_d_ , you just press your joystick , you get here a programme . on the t_v_ you don't it doesn't display on the t_v_ now . if you have the l_c_d_ , then uh there is no meaning in having it on the t_v_ . but you cannot display all on a l_c_d_ . anyway for for the users who who who opt for l_c_d_ we'll give them the give them the l_c_d_ , so without l_c_d_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ? well i think both are really easy to use and uh well t p the menu are clear , well-organised , so so i will give a six for the easy to use . no it's just if i i see the the f the rate i think it's better to do it without l_c_d_ . because that's with l_c_d_ just will increase the price , so i mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes according to fruit and vegetable or a spongy touch without l_c_d_ and without speech recognition . i have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect . i think the easy to use uh aspect is different for different people . for the young generation easy to use may be very complicated because uh they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons . for kids they want simply the s similarit for the old people they want simplicity , but but uh what i'm trying to say here is that the um we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people . so without l_c_d_ i just take it five ? um six . and it's going to be much simpler to use . so let's go back to our laboratory and to improve on the design . what about the integration of speech recognition ? the speech recogniser is a add-on module . that's going to be an optional . s s oh i think it's better to have this without l_c_d_ . as our programme manager s pro project manager says that without l_c_d_ it is going to reduce the cost also , i think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , because maybe parents will lose these uh but i mean if you have an add-ons , the kids may just uh hide the parental module or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or , the problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component , and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people , and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them . so you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional uh will be optional . but the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ? i think it inc increase . because it's three different pieces uh to to to build but it's i think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the functionalities um on the same module , but uh well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the you're gonna keep the same customer , because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons . i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future . attracting them to come back in again and again . yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be can be upgraded , it would be a good thing right ? and uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls ? uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ? but we are also the um well the components will have to change because uh we have to deal with the shape or uh it could be like this the p_c_b_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all . what we can change is to propose the customers with skins . for example the i the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin and then people just feel that oh i have a new skin and looks better . we can have the same global shape and then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that . i think you need to look into the material . i think the project manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models . project evaluation project satisfaction , for example . i don't know , we have to ask these question . room for creativity . this room is a bit small , but but i think it's okay for us to work with . this is fine for making a presentat for project presentations . and the leadership was excellent . yeah i think so . uh the teamwork was very very good . and new ideas found . come up with new product . yeah and also more well uh more seriously i think it's it's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that , we achieved uh project goal i think . that is within the budget . yes , more or less . without without l_c_d_ , without speech recognition , it will be simple . yeah thank you for your work and\",\n          \"kira bought a new bed this weekend

Summary\n","We've been talking to Microsoft about what they want to do with their next generation of computers, and they've been showing us some of the designs they're considering.\n","Reference Summary\n","mailed you the minutes of the last meeting uh just to save time . uh in this meeting i i'm going to discuss about the trend watching , we have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good , rather than having a functional look and feel uh good . the second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative . and the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use , and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something . when we did uh f fashions uh , recent fashion uh our recent fashion update shows that because uh d you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes , and everything with fruits and vegetables , the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look , hard look . do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff ? the rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co okay , so the interface concept um . um so the method , we looked at existing designs , okay , so most remote controls use graphical interface , um and we also found that there's inconsistent layout , which makes it confusing . but i think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons and we've got some pictures of some uh new remote controls to show you . there's um an l_c_d_ thing , i thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us . this one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse , um and but i'm not exactly sure how you'd use that , but the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side . but i presume that the functions must come up on the t_v_ screen . again that's just quite boring shape , grey , looks quite space-agey , but too many buttons , i think on that one . um this one i thought was really cool . it's w it's got the programmability function that we talked about . and it's quite an organic shape yeah , i m i mean the one thing i think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um , i've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing . so like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever . and this one , the over-sized one , i don't know about you , but i think it's a bit too gimmicky . i like some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything , and i've just got an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in . i think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good . you program it like you say , record , um and then , play , and then , record , play machine , and stuff like that , the raised symbols i thought were good , the l_c_d_ , it does look smart , but i think maybe for our budget , 'cause i think we're definitely going for the speech recognition , but in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more , it's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty , you know . i'm not sure if the if for twenty five euros uh per uh twelve euros fifty m manufacturing cost , . although , th i mean to be to be sure they have got i mean they are going crazy with the l_c_d_ technology now , and one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use , so i think i'm not sure about the l_c_d_ . it's a it's great , it's a good idea , but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use , it's not the thing we should go for , i think . we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape , i think . well , si since we're going for the uh the k the sort of company colours , i think your lemon wasn't that far s i like i like the colourful buttons as well . i like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff . and the mouse one , i thought it was a good idea , child-friendly , i thought this was good , i guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among , and i'll i'll give you the uh , i guess , technical considerations for those . and i'm gonna use the whiteboard , just 'cause we haven't used it . the way i'm gonna do this is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls , see how they work , and then we'll throw in our new innovations um um you open it up , there's a circuit board inside , and there's a a chip , a processor , the t_a_ one one eight three five , which um receives input from the buttons , um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier , which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps , and then that gets sent to the uh to the l_e_d_ light , um . so you know , as we said , we got the outer casing , which we have to decide , you know , what's it gonna be , processor , um we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had , um so for the casing , uh this an e-mail i got from our manufacturing team uh , you know , we have a bunch of options from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , whatnot , um latex , double-curved , curved . well , i mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it , and that would k also give it kinda durability and ther that's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast . so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath ? i like the rubber , the stress balls , i think , w like , 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours so multi-coloured buttons . or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish , perhaps . although i mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well . i mean double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use , like uh an hour glass kind of figure , okay , like we could have a big banana shaped remote control , mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip . yeah . how would you point it ? we could have a little l_e_d_s on each end . y i'm i'm not sure about the banana idea . it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe . i think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape . so maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ? you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape , or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want . there's a good man . there's a good idea . yeah , what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ? uh i could put the microphone here . okay , well we can do some user test with scroll-wheels , right ? uh speech recognition , i think , so should the microphone be just anywhere on it or what about the glow-in-the-dark thing , the strip around it ? i mean how good is the speech recognition thing ? do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit ? l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh , i dunno , an apple . but yeah , about the speech thing , it doesn't have to be hand held or close . we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes , different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece . button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side . so in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape . s i guess we decided on material , so that that spongy latex rubber everything feel , well , i i'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing , and i think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick , but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that , because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know . so again i mean like we could have , uh i mean , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different i mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour , so you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing . um as for the energy source um , you know , almost every remote control uses just batteries , we can use a hand-dynamo . so , this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab , you can shake it if it's out of power . but but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo , tha these type of cells ? it does leave them with an obligation to uh there's solar power . um . uh , solar power will w also not be a good idea , i think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea . so that not only it doubles as a stand , but um for using it as uh recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition . having a rechargeable stand , and if we if we're just having buttons and the speech then we're getting our cheapest option of chipping . i just dele i just accidentally deleted what i was supposed to say next . and what i would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay . uh our next meeting's in half an hour um and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches . okay . save everything to the shared documents , is that right ? you have to keep your pen separate , because i used your pen . i wonder if they mean like literally make it , sort of buttons and everything . or we are going to discuss something ? uh no , i think that's us our discussion over um uh we'll probably get questionnaire in a minute , there we go . warning , finish meeting now .\n"]}],"source":["print(\"Actual
